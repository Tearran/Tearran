- A little #cvs in my life
- A little #bash by my side
- A little bit of #documentation all I need
- A little bit of #markdown is what I see
- A little bit of #sqlite in the #html5
- A little bit of #python all night long
- A little bit of #javascript here I am
- A little bit of this makes its the plan
